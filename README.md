# Beer E-Commerce Challenge & Python Tasks

This repository contains the following:

* **beer-e-commerce-client:** The front-end (client-side) code for the Beer E-Commerce challenge, built with React.
* **beer-e-commerce-server:** The back-end (server-side) code for the Beer E-Commerce challenge, built with Node.js and Express.
* **challenge_python.py:** A Python file containing solutions to a separate Python challenge.

## Running the Beer E-Commerce Challenge

1. Navigate to the `beer-e-commerce-server` directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file to start the backend server.
2. Navigate to the `beer-e-commerce-client` directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file to start the frontend development server.

## Python Challenge

Refer to the comments and instructions within the `challenge_python.py` file for details on the Python challenge.

## Additional Notes

* Each directory (`beer-e-commerce-client` and `beer-e-commerce-server`) has its own `README.md` file with specific instructions for that part of the project.
* Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed for both the front-end and back-end projects.
